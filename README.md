# Popup Smart Case

## Features

The web application is an exampla of todo list.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS]
- [React-Redux]
- [React-Router]
- [React-Axios]
- [Ant Design]

And of course the todo-app itself is open source with a [public repository][todo]
on GitHub.

## Installation

After clone the project, under the main folder, you should run below commands

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
